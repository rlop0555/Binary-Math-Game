# Binary-Math-Game
The mental binary math game is a game that requires 1 player. A player will use a button to generate a random number. The player must enter a value using the player switches so that both numbers add up to 15, or hexadecimal value F. The 4 switches represent a binary number. Each switch represents a binary digit. A binary digit (bit) can take on the value of either a 1 or a 0. When a switch is down, the bit is set to 0; when the switch is up, the bit is set to 1. When a bit is set to one, it represents a number that is equal to a power of 2. The right most switch represents the least significant bit, or bit 0. This means that the number represented by this bit when set to 1, will be 2^0. The next switch will represent 2^1, the next will be 2^2, and the last will be 2^3. When the player successfully sums both values to a 15, the 2nd LED on the left-hand side with light up in red, indicating that the player has successfully entered the correct input. When the sum is not equal to 15, the left most LED will light up in red. The objective of the game is to get as many successful inputs as possible in 99 seconds. Additionally, the game has now gained an authentication feature to allow players to have a go at the game. Previously, players were able to just turn on the board and were allowed to play. Now, players must enter a password using the third button and the 4 left-most switches to gain access to the game. Once authenticated, the 7 segment displays will display the timer of 99 seconds, a random number, the sum, and the playerâ€™s value which should be 0 as no input has been entered with the load button.
